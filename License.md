### Summary of Code for Each File

- **`data_collection.py`**: Collects data from an API and saves it as a CSV file.
- **`data_processing.py`**: Cleans and processes the collected data (e.g., dropping missing values, transforming columns).
- **`etl_pipeline.py`**: Automates the full ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load).

By following these steps, you’ll have your code populated and ready to run your data engineering project. Once the code is written, don’t forget to test your scripts and adjust paths or data sources as needed!
