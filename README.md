# Data Engineering Project: ETL Pipeline

This is a simple data engineering project that demonstrates the process of collecting, processing, and storing sales data through an automated ETL pipeline.

## Purpose
- Collect data from an external API.
- Clean and transform the collected data.
- Automate the ETL process and store the final processed data.

## Files
1. **data_collection.py** - Collects data from an external API.
2. **data_processing.py** - Processes the collected data (data cleaning and transformations).
3. **etl_pipeline.py** - Automates the ETL process: Extracts data, transforms it, and loads it into a CSV file.
4. **README.md** - Project documentation.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
